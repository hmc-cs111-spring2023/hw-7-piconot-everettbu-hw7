# Design


## Who is the target for this design, e.g., are you assuming any knowledge on the part of the language users?
This design is targeted for those who know the cha cha slide and want the picobot to act accordingly


## Why did you choose this design, i.e., why did you think it would be a good idea for users to express the maze-searching computation using this syntax?
I chose this design because it is fun (not necessarily practical). However, I thought that it would be helpful to be able to move the picobot using commands such as left, right, up and down


## What behaviors are easier to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design?  If there are no such behaviors, why not?
Simple movements such as left, right, up and down which correspond to NESW


## What behaviors are more difficult to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design? If there are no such behaviors, why not?
My design will not account for walls so it will be difficult to identify when the Picobot is in a corner. There are no such behaviors because the cha cha slide does not have any lines to express these behaviors


## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is “very different”), how different is your syntax from PicoBot’s original design?
4?


## Is there anything you would improve about your design?
