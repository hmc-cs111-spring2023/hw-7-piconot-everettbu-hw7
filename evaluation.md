# Evaluation: running commentary

## Internal DSL

_Describe each change from your ideal syntax to the syntax you implemented, and
describe_ why _you made the change._

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "a lot"), how much did you have to change your syntax?**

A decent amount, I have spent multiple hours working on this and can not figure out how to get it running without errors. I am now at a point where I will be happy if I can just change the syntax of the direction that tells the bot where to move next.

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "very difficult"), how difficult was it to map your syntax to the provided API?**
